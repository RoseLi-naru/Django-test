# Django Test
Just following the official Django tutorial to figure out how Django works.

Did not go as far as testing, but completed the app.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Django installed. For new Python users, remember to do this on a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
pip install django
```

To run, navigate to the `potatoes` directory:
```
cd potatoes
```
Then run:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

### Creating the Superuser:
Follow the instructions laid out [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial02/).
